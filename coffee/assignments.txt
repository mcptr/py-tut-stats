## Info

The whole dataset is read from csv file
and stored in a dict.
To load the specific data you can ```import data```,
and use the provided "get" passing the desired field name.

Example:
To get the values for the "Moisture", use:
```
data.get("Moisture")
```

The returned values will be lists of strings.
You will need to convert them to desired data types (floats or int) as required.

## Assignments

1. Basic plotting.
   a) Plot the values of the "Moisture" column.
   b) Sort the sorted list of the "Moisture" values.
   
2. What is the mean number of the "Moisture" score?
   Interpret the result.

3. Take a random sample of 20 "Total.Cup.Points" values and calculate the mean.

   Now, do the same for the sample taken multiple times:
   1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 30000, 50000

   Collect the means of each random sample and calculate the total mean of the collected samples' means.
   Explain the observations.

   If you do it hundreds or thousands of times does the mean tend to any value?

   Plot the results.
   Put the number of iterations on x-axis, and mean on y-axis.

4. Calculate the median number of:
   Aroma, Moisture, Color, Acidity, Flavor, Aftertaste, Body.

   Interpret the result, compare median with arithmetic mean (for "Moisture").

5. Calculate the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile
   using "Total.Cup.Points".
   Interpret the results.

6. Find the mode (most frequent values) of the "Flavor" values?
   Also, print min, max and the mean.

7. Group the "Total.Cup.Points" in the buckets.
   Plot data for different bucket sizes (5, 25, 50).
